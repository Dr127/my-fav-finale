    My hooby is reading interesting books in my free time. Whenever I go home from my school I like to read such books completing my homework. I am 10 years old and read chapter books like "Harry Potter" and "Warriors". Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me feel complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone, however I got into this naturally. Reading books can keep someone happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration, and insturction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctaul, and most importantly a successful person in life.

    My favorite book character is Harry from the series Harry Potter. After a wizard named Voldemort tries to kill Harry in a attack on his house (killing his parents). Harry is sent to his uncle's house, where he lives for ten long unhappy years. On his 11th birthday, he is taken to a wizarding school called Hogwarts. He then gathers a group of friends, and has a series of adventure. While Voldemort plots, and waits for the time to return.
